### Credentials ###
# This SSH key is used for all deployed hosts in EC2
# It must exist in the AWS region you are using for testing.
#
ssh_key = ~/.ssh/<your_aws_key_here>.pem

# A user account will be created on BIG-IP during the provisioning
#  process with these credentials
#
bigip_rest_user = 'your_username_here'
bigip_rest_password = 'your_password_here'

# These are the AWS keys that will be placed on the BIGIP if there's a cluster.
# (ex. Used to reassign secondary IPs associated with VIPs, change route tables, etc)
# Best Practice is using separate keys for BIGIP IAM user with limited permissions to modify those network elements
#
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_IAM.html
# Otherwise, you can set the same keys you have configured for BOTO environment
# If you aren't testing a cluster, you can just leave them as empty quotes
