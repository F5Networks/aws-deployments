This directory contains two python modules:

f5_aws
This module provides a CLI and python class interface to manage
deployments of F5 services in AWS.  

service_catalog
This module uses pyramid from the pylons project to run an example
service catalog.  This service catalog is meant to provide a nice
visualization layer for the f5_aws module above. 

See the /docs directory in the root level of this project for more information.
