This directory contains two python modules:

f5_aws
This module provides a CLI and python class interface to manage
deployments of F5 services in AWS.  

service_catalog (removed, see commit 8522697d4beacdf0abea1e881abc21c25b7ed6e3)
This module uses pyramid from the pylons project to run an example
service catalog.  This service catalog is meant to provide a nice
visualization layer for the f5_aws module above. 

See the /docs directory in the root level of this project for more information.
