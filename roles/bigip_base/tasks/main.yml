## Some initial setup for big ip once we can login.  We need a user for rest calls.  We also want the default shell
# to be bash, rather than tmsh.  The latter is difficult to use ansible...
# Finally, turn of the setup wizard so if anyone does every login in, they aren't prompted to setup the device.
