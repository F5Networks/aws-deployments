# This directory helps build a docker container to run this demo from.
# It assumes you:
#   * have docker installed (example: running from a linux desktop)
#   * have git cloned aws-deployments
      and are running these commands from inside this directory "/aws-deployments/docker"

# Step 1: Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile located in this directory
sudo docker build -t f5demo .

# Step 2: Launch docker container
sudo docker run -v /aws-deployments:/aws-deployments -i -t f5demo

# Step 3: Now follow instructions from the main repo README
